NEWS file for ttystatus
=======================


Version 0.10, released 2011-03-23
---------------------------------

* Fix handling of /dev/tty not being avilable. This can happen, e.g., when
  things are run from cron.


Version 0.9, released 2011-02-13
--------------------------------

* Add ttystatus.Integer.


Version 0.8.1, released 2011-01-30
--------------------------------

* Do not write notifications if output is disabled.


Version 0.8, released 2011-01-30
--------------------------------

* Write status output to /dev/tty by default.


Version 0.7, released 2010-10-09
--------------------------------

* Fix bug that failed to show the last few updates when .finish() was called.


Version 0.6, released 2010-07-13
--------------------------------

* Add ByteSpeed widget.


Version 0.5, released 2010-07-07
--------------------------------

* Speed optimization: widgets are now only updated when the values they're
  interested are updated, and widgets are now only formatted when the result
  is actually going to be printed. For long-running processes with 
  frequent updates, this saves a lot of unnecessary computation.
* Debian packaging fix: Add Python-Version headers.


Version 0.4, released 2010-07-05
--------------------------------

* Bugfix: when the output won't fit, and the last widget is a `Pathname`,
  the last character is no longer chopped off.
