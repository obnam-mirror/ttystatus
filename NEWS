NEWS file for ttystatus
=======================

Version 0.34, released 2016-12-26
---------------------------------

* Require Python 2.7.
* Add a missing empty line needed for PEP8 compliance. This caused a
  failure in the test suite, no idea why it wasn't caught when making
  the previous release.

Version 0.32, released 2016-01-09
---------------------------------

* Fix some variable type changes found by pylint.

Version 0.31, released 2016-01-09
---------------------------------

* Fix bug in how areas on the terminal are erased. This exhibited
  itself by the `TerminalStatus.notify` method not removing an
  existing status message before writing out the notification.

* Fix bug in `TerminalStatus.flush` that meant it did not, in fact,
  flush the output.

Version 0.30, released 2015-10-17
---------------------------------

* Strip ASCII control characters from displayed output (but expand
  TABs) in widget values. This avoids TABs making values longer than
  expected, and terminals getting confused by control sequences.

* New method `ttystatus.TerminalStatus.get_terminal_size` returns
  terminal width and height.

* Speed up updates by not updating widgets if they aren't interested
  in the variable that got changed. This only works for widgets added
  with the `format` method, but that should be all of them for anyone
  not liking verbose, tedious code.

Version 0.29, released 2015-10-10
---------------------------------

* Do not write a newline to terminal when `finish()` is called, if
  there is not output to the terminal otherwise. The point of the
  newline is to make sure the shell prompt starts at the beginning of
  a new line.

Version 0.28, released 2015-10-10
---------------------------------

* Fix another case where terminal capabilities are queried and the
  terminal isn't capable.

Version 0.27, released 2015-10-10
---------------------------------

* Improve speed when progress output is disabled, by avoiding
  pointless rendering.

Version 0.26, released 2015-10-06
---------------------------------

* Fix looking up of capabilities when there is not terminal. Reported
  by Sharon Kimble.

Version 0.25, released 2015-10-05
---------------------------------

* Fix handling of a terminal without the necessary capabilities, by
  disabling output.

Version 0.24.1, released 2015-10-01
---------------------------------

* Fix handling the case of the process not having a terminal to talk
  to. Reported by Juergen Nickelsen.

Version 0.24, released 2015-09-30
---------------------------------

* Output can now be on multiple lines. Add newlines to format string.

Version 0.23, released 2013-06-19
---------------------------------

* No longer use the SIGWINCH handler, since that causes problems when
  applications do certain kinds of I/O and the signal interrupts it.
  Libraries shouldn't install signal handlers like this. Instead,
  query the terminal width whenever making updates.

Version 0.22, released 2013-03-12
---------------------------------

* When the terminal size changes, ttystatus will now update the display
  at once.

Version 0.21, released 2012-09-29
-----------------------------------

* Updated README with information about where the output goes, and that
  it is restricted to one line.

Version 0.20, released 2012-09-23
---------------------------------

* `TerminalStatus.error` now always outputs. Error messages are too valuable
  to lose.

Version 0.19, released 2012-06-30
---------------------------------

* Added a `TerminalStatus.flush` method, to allow forcing an update.

Version 0.18, released 2012-05-08
---------------------------------

* `ByteSpeed` can now show average speed over a short period of time
  (which approximates current speed), instead of over the whole duration 
  of the program.

Version 0.17, released 2012-04-15
---------------------------------

* Committed genocide towards whole civilizations of rendering problems.

Version 0.16, released 2012-04-08
---------------------------------

* Speed up by avoiding to format widgets until it's time to update.

Version 0.15, released 2011-09-17
---------------------------------

* Bugfix: the String widget now handles non-string values.

Version 0.14, released 2011-08-31
---------------------------------

* Notifications are written to the standard output, not the terminal.
* A method for printing error messages is provided. They are printed to
  the standard error.
* The `PercentDone` class handles zero total amounts better now.
* Widgets may now be added using a simple format string. See
  `ttystatus.TerminalStatus.format` method.

Version 0.13, released 2011-08-18
---------------------------------

* No upstream changes, but released with a new upstream version so that
  Debian packaging does not need to get convoluted.

Version 0.12, released 2011-07-24
---------------------------------

* API documentation is now done with Sphinx.
* The SIGWINCH signal is now marked as a re-starting one, so that socket I/O
  is not interrupted when an application uses ttystatus and the terminal is
  resized.

Version 0.11, released 2011-04-23
---------------------------------

* `pydoc ttystatus` now works better: you no longer need to access 
  modules to see the exported classes. Instead, see all of them directly.
* A final newline is no longer written out if there has been no output
  otherwise.


Version 0.10, released 2011-03-23
---------------------------------

* Fix handling of /dev/tty not being avilable. This can happen, e.g., when
  things are run from cron.


Version 0.9, released 2011-02-13
--------------------------------

* Add ttystatus.Integer.


Version 0.8.1, released 2011-01-30
--------------------------------

* Do not write notifications if output is disabled.


Version 0.8, released 2011-01-30
--------------------------------

* Write status output to /dev/tty by default.


Version 0.7, released 2010-10-09
--------------------------------

* Fix bug that failed to show the last few updates when .finish() was called.


Version 0.6, released 2010-07-13
--------------------------------

* Add ByteSpeed widget.


Version 0.5, released 2010-07-07
--------------------------------

* Speed optimization: widgets are now only updated when the values they're
  interested are updated, and widgets are now only formatted when the result
  is actually going to be printed. For long-running processes with 
  frequent updates, this saves a lot of unnecessary computation.
* Debian packaging fix: Add Python-Version headers.


Version 0.4, released 2010-07-05
--------------------------------

* Bugfix: when the output won't fit, and the last widget is a `Pathname`,
  the last character is no longer chopped off.
